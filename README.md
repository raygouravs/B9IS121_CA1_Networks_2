## Overview
This project is about automation of infrastructure provisioning, configuration, containerization, and deployment of a web application on AWS using:
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning (EC2 instance)
- **Ansible** for configuration management and deployment
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Azure DevOps** for CI/CD pipeline automation

## Workflow Summary

1. **Terraform** creates the EC2 instance and networking setup.
2. **Ansible** handles Docker installation container deployment on the EC2.
3. **Docker** builds the docker image of the web app.
4. **Azure DevOps Pipeline** automates build and deployment on code check-in.

## Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps Account (with service connection to GitHub)
- AWS Account (with access keys)
- Terraform, Ansible, Docker installed locally
- SSH access to EC2 instance

---

## Getting Started
